🔐 Password Security & Brute Force Attack 

🔓 First, How Attackers Get Passwords in the First Place
Attackers are constantly targeting login pages across the internet. They use automated tools and bots to try thousands (or millions) of username and password combinations. Most of the time, they don’t even come up with passwords themselves — they use huge password lists that are leaked on the dark web.

There’s literally a market where stolen credentials are bought and sold. That’s why if one of your passwords leaks, attackers can use it to try and log into your other accounts too.


💻 Why Brute-Forcing Is Still Dangerous Today
Even though brute-forcing seems like an old-school method, it's still very powerful because of how fast computers are now. Modern attackers don’t just randomly guess passwords — they use smart, well-structured lists, combine different methods (like dictionary + rules), and run attacks using powerful machines or even distributed networks (like botnets).

This kind of computational persistence is what makes brute-force attacks dangerous even today — they don’t stop until they get in.
